This project involves analyzing my personal YouTube activity over the course of a year (2022). The goal was to gain insights into my viewing habits and identify patterns that could inform future content consumption decisions.

The project uses Python and several data analysis libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to clean and manipulate the data, visualize the results, and perform statistical analysis.

* The analysis covers a range of topics, including:
* Most watched channels and videos
* Time of day and day of week preferences for watching
* Changes in viewing habits over the course of the year
* Correlations between video length and watch time
* Correlations between video category and watch time

The results of the analysis are presented in various forms, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, to make the insights easily digestible and visually engaging.

Overall, this project provides a valuable case study of how personal data can be analyzed to gain meaningful insights and inform future decisions.
